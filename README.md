## Contributing

> **Note:** All commits are now GPG signed and verified. Earlier commits were unsigned due to initial setup, but this has been rectified for transparency and authenticity.
---

**Planned:**

- Category management (add, edit, delete)
- In-app reading (EPUB, PDF, plain text/HTML)
- Book cover uploads
- User profile page and preferences
- Sticky notes and highlights for digital books
- Public profiles and book lists
- Responsive design enhancements
- Advanced search and filtering

---

### Email Verification

- Users must verify their email address after signup.
- Verification emails are sent using Resend SMTP.
- Tokens expire after 24 hours; users can request a new verification email if needed.
- Only verified users can log in.
- **After successful email verification, users are redirected to the landing page, the login modal opens automatically, and a success message is displayed.**

---

### Session Expiration & Logout

- Sessions use sliding expiration: users stay logged in as long as they are active.
- If a session expires due to inactivity, the user is redirected to the landing page, sees a "Your session has expired! Please, login again." message, and the login modal opens automatically.
- Users can log out at any time via the logout route, which destroys the session and redirects to the landing page.

---

**Progress:**

- [x] Generate and store verification tokens on signup
- [x] Send verification email using Resend SMTP
- [x] Create a ‚ÄúCheck your email‚Äù page after signup
- [x] Add /auth/verify-email route and controller logic
- [x] Redirect to landing page with login modal open and success message after email verification
- [x] Update login logic to require verified email
- [x] Implement sliding session expiration and session expired modal flow
