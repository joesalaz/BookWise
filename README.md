## Dropdown System

BookWise includes a simple dropdown system for navigation menus:

### Basic Usage

```javascript
// Create a dropdown
const dropdown = new Dropdown('buttonId', 'menuId');

// For mobile menus with custom animations
const mobileDropdown = DropdownUtils.createCustomDropdown(
    'menuBtn', 
    'mobileNav',
    ['opacity-100', 'visible', 'max-h-96'],
    ['opacity-0', 'invisible', 'max-h-0']
);
```

### Files

- `public/classes/Dropdown.js` - Main dropdown class
- `public/classes/DropdownUtils.js` - Helper utilities
- `public/javascripts/dropdown-manager.js` - Manages all dropdowns

## Migration Safety Scripts

BookWise includes smart migration scripts to prevent data loss during deployment:

### Available Migration Commands

```bash
# Basic Sequelize commands
npm run migrate               # Run all pending migrations (default)
npm run migrate:status        # Check migration status

# Safe migration commands
npm run migrate:safe          # Check status then run migrations
npm run migrate:smart         # Smart migration with pending check
npm run migrate:advanced      # Advanced migration with backup support
```

### Migration Scripts

- **`smart-migrate.js`** - Checks for pending migrations before running
- **`advanced-migrate.js`** - Comprehensive safety with backup support  
- **`migrate-safely.sh`** - Shell script wrapper for safe migrations

### Production Safety

These scripts prevent accidental data loss by:

- Only running pending migrations (not all migrations)
- Providing detailed logging of what's being executed
- Offering backup support (advanced script)
- Avoiding re-running already applied migrations

**Recommended for production deployments:** Use `npm run migrate:smart` instead of `npm run migrate` to ensure safe database updates.

## Contributing

> **Note:** All commits are now GPG signed and verified. Earlier commits were unsigned due to initial setup, but this has been rectified for transparency and authenticity.
---

**Planned:**

- Category management (add, edit, delete)
- In-app reading (EPUB, PDF, plain text/HTML)
- Book cover uploads
- User profile page and preferences
- Sticky notes and highlights for digital books
- Public profiles and book lists
- Responsive design enhancements
- Advanced search and filtering

---

### Email Verification

- Users must verify their email address after signup.
- Verification emails are sent using Resend SMTP.
- Tokens expire after 24 hours; users can request a new verification email if needed.
- Only verified users can log in.
- **After successful email verification, users are redirected to the landing page, the login modal opens automatically, and a success message is displayed.**

---

### Session Expiration & Logout

- Sessions use sliding expiration: users stay logged in as long as they are active.
- If a session expires due to inactivity, the user is redirected to the landing page, sees a "Your session has expired! Please, login again." message, and the login modal opens automatically.
- Users can log out at any time via the logout route, which destroys the session and redirects to the landing page.

---

**Progress:**

- [x] Generate and store verification tokens on signup
- [x] Send verification email using Resend SMTP
- [x] Create a ‚ÄúCheck your email‚Äù page after signup
- [x] Add /auth/verify-email route and controller logic
- [x] Redirect to landing page with login modal open and success message after email verification
- [x] Update login logic to require verified email
- [x] Implement sliding session expiration and session expired modal flow

## Production Considerations

BookWise works great out of the box for development and small-scale deployments. If you're planning to use this in a production environment with multiple users or want to scale it up, here are some things you'll want to address:

### Session Storage

The app currently uses Express's default in-memory session store. While this works fine for development, it has some limitations in production:

- Sessions don't persist across server restarts
- Memory usage grows over time without cleanup
- Can't scale across multiple server instances

For production use, consider switching to:

- **Redis** - Fast and reliable, great for high-traffic apps
- **Database sessions** - Store sessions in your existing database
- **MongoDB sessions** - If you prefer document-based storage

You might notice a warning about this in your deployment logs - that's normal and expected.

### Database

The default SQLite setup is perfect for getting started, but for production you might want to consider PostgreSQL or MySQL for better performance with concurrent users.

### Other Considerations

- Set up proper environment variables for production
- Configure HTTPS and security headers
- Add rate limiting and request validation
- Set up logging and monitoring

These aren't urgent for getting started, but they become important as your the application grows.
